    <p>By using the website, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the website. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the website, any part of the website, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the website, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the website into other languages, or make derivative versions. The website itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to MusicMindProject.</p>
    <p>MusicMindProject is committed to ensuring that the website is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the website or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the website or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
    <p>The MusicMind website stores and processes data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your access to the site secure.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that MusicMindProject will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the website will require the website to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but MusicMindProject cannot take responsibility for the website not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p>If you’re using the website outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the website, or other third party charges. In using the website, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the website outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the website, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the website.</p>
    <p>Along the same lines, MusicMindProject cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the website i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, MusicMindProject cannot accept responsibility</p>
    <p>With respect to MusicMindProject’s responsibility for your use of the website, when you’re using the website, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. MusicMindProject accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the website.</p>
